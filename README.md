# House Price Prediction - Kaggle Competition
This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle competition, which challenges participants to predict the final sales price of homes in Ames, Iowa, using 79 explanatory variables. This project focuses on feature engineering and advanced regression techniques to deliver the most accurate predictions.

## Practice Skills
Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from the dataset to improve model performance. Advanced Regression Techniques: Implementing Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and other methods to predict the target variable. Dataset The dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for data science education purposes, and it has become a modern alternative to the Boston Housing dataset.

## Evaluation
The predictions are evaluated using Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE), computed on the logarithm of the predicted and actual sale prices. This metric ensures that errors in predicting both expensive and affordable houses have a similar impact on the result.

## Technologies:
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
xgboost
matplotlib
seaborn
